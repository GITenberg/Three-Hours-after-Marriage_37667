<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>It is a privilege to have a part in this reprint of what is certainly
one of the wittiest plays in the language, and one of the most neglected.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Its tripartite authorship and raffish character have encouraged
editors to bypass it. The 1717 London edition and Dublin reprint
the same year bore no author's name on the title-page, but as
Gay signed the Advertisement one would think his editors would have
felt it somewhat incumbent on them to keep the play alive. However,
so far as I have been able to discover, only the 1795 collected edition
of Gay does its duty in this respect, and the editor of Gay's
plays in the Abbey Classics (2 vols., 1923) refused to admit it there,
claiming that though "this justly abused piece" had been ascribed
to Gay, "the authors of the greater part were Pope and Arbuthnot."
<i>Three Hours</i> has fared somewhat better as a work of Pope, but interest
in reprinting it under his aegis seems to have died out early
in the nineteenth century, where the Twickenham Edition (VI, 180)
locates two collections of writings attached to Pope that include
it&mdash;very far to the back of the volume in each case. Since then,
nothing, except for a few scraps in G. C. Faber's <i>Poetical Works
of Gay</i>, 1926.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
Since this introduction was written the <i>Johnsonian News Letter</i> for
June 1961 has announced that an edition of <i>Three Hours</i> is being prepared
and may be expected to appear at an early date. It is gratifying to learn
that the play is receiving this attention and I hope that this reprint may
be of use to the editors in their task.</p></div>

<p>Not much can be done with the play in the space here available,
but neither is a complete treatment attempted. Our purpose is to
dispel the impression that <i>Three Hours</i> is "dull"<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (or so risqu&eacute; that
in the public interest it should be kept from general circulation) and
to bring it to the attention of more scholars. Certainly the present
discussion does not aim to pre-empt the possibilities for study; much
will remain to conquer still-for example, the knotty problem of which
author wrote precisely which parts of the play, if anyone wants to
try an untangling here&mdash;I prefer to think it a collaboration through
and through, though some tracks of individuals may be made out.</p>

<p>In the selection of the text to be reproduced for this series the
first edition (somewhat unexpectedly) had competition, not from the
London 1757 <i>Supplement</i> to Pope's works, but from the version of
the play given in the three Dublin printings of the collection of this
title: 1757, 1758, 1761. The Dublin play is not merely a debased
version of 1717: it is in five acts, 1717 in three, and it contains a
sentence of dialogue that 1717 does not: these differences, when
taken in conjunction with the prefatory remarks that Gay wrote for
the 1717 printing, made it possible to determine (readers will find
the argument set forth further on, in a note to the Advertisement)
that Dublin, though printed so long after the event (and somewhat
butchered by the type-setter, we admit, but corrections of his worst
misreadings and typos will be found in the notes) dates from the
year 1717 just as the other does, was the script used in the production
of the play, and actually was the one that Gay thought Lintot
would use in the edition he published. The other consideration inclining
us toward the Dublin version of the play was that only in its
printings can one get the Key and Letter which, a number of years
ago, George Sherburn had in a copy of 1761 and used with such
striking effect in his article on the "Fortunes and Misfortunes" of
the play;<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he quoted liberally from both documents but they seemed
to us so interesting as to be worth putting into the reader's hands
entire.</p>

<p>Thus it boiled down to a choice between the two earlier Dublin
printings; 1761, it seemed, would not need to be checked. The kindness
of the Harvard College Library made it possible to compare its
copy of 1757 with the Clark Library's copy of 1758, and in the light
of the data furnished by the Clark's Supervising Bibliographer, Mr.
William E. Conway, the Clark copy could be settled upon; the differences,
though slight&mdash;there was little resetting from 1757 to 1758,
and none in the play proper&mdash;were in its favor.</p>

<p>Any study of the play must begin with Professor Sherburn's article&mdash;it
is still indispensable, factually&mdash;but in its findings scholars
have perhaps let it influence them more than they should have.
John Wilson Bowyer was exceptional in challenging one of its
identifications<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (successfully, I thought); perhaps the time has now
come for re-examining some of its other theses&mdash;for example, the
doctrine (which has become so firmly embedded in the scholarship
on the play) that the authors intended the role of Plotwell as a satire
on Cibber. This was suggested at the time in the <i>Key</i> to the
play by E. Parker, but any charge brought by this person might well
have been looked at askance; for, whoever he was, he was avowedly
a champion of "that elaborate Gentleman," "the learned Dr.
W&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;d" (Woodward, one of the real people attacked in the play)
and might be suspected of hoping to cause an embroilment. It seems
clear that prior to the play's premi&egrave;re there was no rift between the
management at Drury Lane and the authors. Parker says that they
were constantly in attendance at rehearsals, and our Letter (p. 216)
avers that they were more than satisfied with what Cibber was doing
with their work. It rings true; the line attributed to Gay, "We dug
the ore, but he [Cibber] refined the gold" exaggerates greatly no
doubt, but seems beyond the powers of our female informant to have
contrived in support of a thesis. An atmosphere of happy optimism
prevailed; Lintot (Parker says) predicted that the play "would surprize
the whole Town," and it was reported that he had given 50
guineas for the publishing rights (this item from John Durant Breval&mdash;signing
himself "Joseph Gay"&mdash;p. 30 of <i>The Confederates</i>, 1717).<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>That in all this sweetness and light there should have been a
plan to make Cibber ridiculous, and he too stupid to realize this until
he had trod the stage as Plotwell and felt the impact of the lines
directed at him personally, is unbelievable on the face of it. How
could the alleged plotters have been sure that when Colley came to
cast the play he would not frustrate their deep-laid plan by assigning
Plotwell to some other actor, if only by mere chance?</p>

<p>The theory has fed on some misreadings of the play that must
have an end put to them if this ghost is to be laid. If the reader,
then, will pardon the obviousness of the following, it is true that
Cibber wrote plays, but the name Plotwell should not be taken in
this sense, but merely as suggesting the gallant skilled in the stratagems
which, in the older comedies, males of this class had been
accustomed to use in their cuckolding operations. Plotwell in the
play has never set pen to paper except for notes sent to wives, and
he is not an "actor-manager" or the like. He and Underplot are simply
gentlemen who spend so much of their time in intrigues in real
life that they would have no time for play-writing.<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the part of
<i>Three Hours</i> that has led scholars down this false path&mdash;the scene
in which the manuscript is judged by Sir Tremendous and the players&mdash;it
must be kept in mind that the actual author of the work being
dismembered is Phoebe Clinket, not Plotwell, who, since he is
merely fronting for her, is enabled to meet such strictures as "Between
you and I, this gentleman knows nothing of poetry" with perfect
sang-froid; it is Phoebe whose withers are comically wrung.
Thus there was nothing in the part to offend Cibber, much less can
resentment on his part be deduced from the intermission of the play
after the seventh night.<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The squabble involving Pope, Gay, and Cibber must have begun
with the latter's allusion to our play in the revival of <i>The Rehearsal</i>
on February 7, a couple of weeks after <i>Three Hours</i> had
closed. Cibber's version of how it happened may be read in the
Letter (pp. 217-218 below); our female correspondent sympathized
with him and deleted a few expressions indicative of animus on his
part, but on the whole the quote as she gives it is a reasonable facsimile
of what he had said in the <i>Letter to Pope</i> (1742). His disclaimer
of an intent to offend is believable in the light of what we
have just seen as to how Plotwell should be read in the play; on
the other side, Pope's anger at the gag&mdash;though not any visit by
him to Cibber, that is true&mdash;is attested both by Breval and by "Timothy
Drub" (<i>A Letter to Mr. John Gay</i>, 1717) who agree that Pope
was the one principally offended and that it was he who sent Gay
with instructions to trounce "that impudent Dog C&mdash;&mdash;r" (this line
from Drub's pamphlet). Why may not Pope have been angry enough
to seek out Cibber himself on the impulse of the moment? It seems
feeble to doubt Cibber's testimony on the grounds that he had not
told the story prior to 1742; he had not previously told the tale of
the youthful Pope in a bagnio, either, yet the authorities think there
might be something to this&mdash;if to the one tale, why not to the other?
As to the account the lady gives of the scuffle between Gay and
Cibber, it was widely known at the time that there had been some
sort of angry meeting between them; her story is highly colored but
nonetheless may be substantially true.<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>This quarrel, whether with both poets involved with Cibber or
only one, doubtless cost the play a revival or two that it would otherwise
have had; with such evidence of anger in the authors Cibber
could well have wished to have done with them and their work. The
use of the crocodile costume on April 2 in a dance at Drury Lane
entitled <i>The Shipwreck</i> suggests that so far as the management was
concerned the play for which it had been devised would not be acted
again. Thereafter, <i>Three Hours</i> had only two revivals (Handlist of
Plays in Nicoll, <i>Early Eighteenth-Century Drama</i>)&mdash;one in 1737 (two
performances) the other in 1746 (three).</p>

<p>A pity! But in any case the play could not have had much of
a life on the stage, considering the climate into which the authors
chose to introduce it. The type of wit that had flourished in the
former age did still hold a place in the theatre in 1717, but only in
such comedies as had already won a place in the repertory.<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>  The
older plays could be "corrected" (that is, the racier lines could be
taken out) or the tender-minded could tolerate them as classics or
in a pinch stay at home when a play known to be of this sort had
been announced. A new play was in a more vulnerable position; it
had to conform to what the reformers had for a couple of decades
been telling audiences a play should be, or squalls could be expected.
Sir Richard Blackmore was continuing the crusade against scapegrace
wit&mdash;in the Preface to his <i>Essays</i>, 1717, he is explicitly severe
upon <i>Three Hours</i> and its authors&mdash;and the battle was going
his way. Jeremy Collier had published nothing on the theatre for
nearly a decade but it is interesting to see his methods applied to
the play by Timothy Drub in his <i>Letter to Gay</i> and Drub then clinching
his remarks with a quote of two pages from "a very elegant author"
whom he does not name but who&mdash;not too surprisingly&mdash;can
be recognized as Collier himself.<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>  (Could "Drub" have been, in
fact, Collier, thus tempted by <i>Three Hours</i> to return to the fray under
this alias?)</p>

<p>In any event the authors must have known that they were offering
to swim against the tide but counted on their combined brilliance
to win anyway. What they wrote happens to conform to the current
rules in one respect&mdash;to paraphrase the epilogue to <i>Love's Last
Shift</i>, no cuckold is made within the limits of its three hours' time
span&mdash;but this compliance must have been accidental, for in every
other respect the play deliberately flouts the regulations as established
by Collier and his school. Obviously the authors were out
to create a sensation: shock the stodgy and respectable element,
jam the play down the throats of the audience, and win the admiration
of the minority with whom libertine wit was still in favor.</p>

<p>These aims, which even a friend and well-wisher has to view
as a bit on the juvenile side, were far from fully achieved. The
description that Breval gives of the behavior of the crowd on the
first night (Sherburn quotes it, if the reader can not readily get hold
of <i>The Confederates</i>) is suggestive, not of a house packed with enemies
of the authors, friends of Dr. Woodward and John Dennis out
to damn the play, but of a crowd that had come predisposed to approve&mdash;"Silent
a while th'attentive Many sate"&mdash;but found themselves
simply unable to endure the dramatic fare set before them. The murmur
that began and then grew to a hiss must have surprised and
alarmed the authors: Breval's version of how they reacted must have
a grain or two of truth in it. In the account of the second and third
nights furnished by our Key one can see matters improving, but it
is clear that to quiet the audience took heroic efforts by the cast
and there was probably some deletion of offending lines,<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> perhaps
some resort to "packing" the house.<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>  This last was a measure
not infrequently taken in those days&mdash;Dr. Johnson's story of Steele's
efforts in behalf of <i>Cato</i> will be recalled&mdash;but this was not what
the authors had anticipated. In the upshot they had dared the unpastured
dragon of reform in his den and had got away with it&mdash;but
barely. They were all right financially&mdash;the run should have brought
them two "benefits"&mdash;and there was the fee from Lintot and an added
present of guineas from those three court ladies who wanted the
world to know that they were sophisticated enough to take the play
in stride. (Pope paid them with "A Court Ballad.") Still, the pride
of the authors must have received some damage; perhaps some sensitiveness
on Pope's part is understandable.</p>

<p>But what the collaboration produced is truly remarkable; if there
is something of a show-off air about it the authors can be forgiven,
in view of what they had to exhibit. Though its fast pace (which
flags only toward the last) and its emphasis on intrigue may slant
it toward farce, <i>Three Hours</i> has the vitality and verve that one
finds only in the very best English comic writing. Phoebe Clinket
and Sir Tremendous are, to me, endlessly enjoyable, and Dr. Fossile
more than merely a caricature of a now forgotten virtuoso or a lifeless
counter in an intrigue plot (though in both these respects he
meets the requirements of the part beautifully); even he has moments
when the humanity shows through&mdash;as in his plaintive line to his
friends when the mummy and the crocodile spring into movement and
speech, "Gentlemen, wonder at nothing within these walls; for ever
since I was married, nothing has happened to me in the common
course of human life." Of the trio composed of Mrs. Townley and
her followers I like them all, for various reasons, but the lady best.
Once she shrieks (p. 186) but considering the circumstances anyone
would consider this justifiable; otherwise she moves through the
incredible crises of her role with a self-possession and an easy
charm and good humor that one can only admire: as if she knew it
was all nonsense but condescended to cooperate for the sake of the
joke.</p>

<p>Among the minor characters one deserves especial mention.
It was probably heartless of the authors to make fun of an aging and
unfortunate (if rather eccentric) lady in "poor Lady Hyppokekoana"
(as her compassionate, but, perforce, ever neglectful physician calls
her) but at least the result was esthetically satisfactory, and I beg
leave to nominate her for listing with that class of comic characters
who, though kept behind the scenes throughout, still come through
unforgettably in the reports we have of them: Mrs. Grundy in <i>Speed
the Plough</i>; Mrs. Harris in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>; Dashenka in <i>The
Cherry Orchard</i>.</p>

of patrons upon which it could rely was limited. A play would run as
long as it continued to draw; when the house began to fall off a new bill
would have to be announced. The intermitting of <i>Three Hours</i> should be

Gay's visit to the fourth of these, i.e., March 21: this is that the dates
on which the two pamphlets that refer to it were advertised ("just before
March 1" for Drub's, and March 30 for Breval's&mdash;Sherburn, p. 91) seem to
rule out a March 21 fracas in the one case and to fall uncomfortably close
in the other. But publication (of course) though announced, may have been
delayed, and it is perhaps worth noticing that in each pamphlet Gay's visit
is mentioned in an inorganic part of the work that could have been added
late: the Dedication in Drub's, and, in Breval's, an ironical "congratulatory
poem" printed after the epilogue, on the last two pages of the book.</p></div>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<p class="ridt"><i><a href="#ADVERTISEMENT">Advertisement</a>, printed exactly as it is acted.</i> In 1717 Gay continued,
"for, tho' the Players in Compliance with the Taste of
the Town, broke it into five Parts in the Representation; yet,
as the Action pauses, and the Stage is left vacant but three
times, so it properly consists but of three Acts, like the <i>Spanish</i>
Comedies." There are several puzzles here. In the first place
for a three-act play the stage should be left vacant twice rather
than three times. But setting this aside there is a contradiction
which must have puzzled any reader who has used the 1717 edition,
namely that if the players broke it into five parts and the
play is printed exactly as it is acted, the play that follows
should be in five acts but actually is in three. The London
1757 <i>Supplement to Pope</i> merely reprints Advertisement and
play as they are in 1717 and it is not until the Dublin printings
that the play appears in the five acts in which Gay says it was
acted.</p>

<p>I suggest that Lintot in 1717 had two scripts of the play,
one in three acts, one in five, and that Gay wrote the Advertisement
under the impression that Lintot would discard the former.</p>

<p>I judge that when W. Whitestone undertook his Dublin Supplement
of 1757 he took the Advertisement from the London
book that had just been published (see the title-page of the volume)
but that when he re-issued his book in 1758 he deleted the
lines quoted above, perceiving that they were not to the point
so far as his text of the play was concerned.</p>

<p>Unless we imagine Whitestone revising the play into five
acts himself we must suppose that he had got his hands on an
authentic acting MS of the play, and it seems not one from a
late revival. I suspect that Whitestone in fact had got the very
MS of the play that Gay thought Lintot was going to print; one
cannot guess from where, but presumably from the same source
that supplied the Key and Letter. Besides the act divisions
the most interesting variant is a speech of a dozen words added
to Dublin; see the note to p. 183. Cibber may have put this in,
or Gay, at Cibber's request. But in either case it seems that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>the text that has it is the one that Gay authorized for printing.</p>

<p>By the same token, the cast as given in the present reprint
(no actors' names are given in Dublin 1757 but they must
have been in the script and in the reprint of 1758 Whitestone
decided to put them in) is more probably correct than that printed
in 1717. The only differences between the two are in five very
minor roles, where, as rehearsals went on, substitutions would
be easy. All the principals are the same.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<p class="stgdir">Enter <span class="smcap">Fossile</span>, leading <span class="smcap">Townley</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp; Welcome, my bride, into the habitation of
thy husband. The scruples of the parson&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  And the fatigue of the ceremony&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Are at last well over.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  These blank licences are wonderful commodious.&mdash;&mdash;The
clergy have a noble command, in
being rangers of the park of matrimony; produce but
a warrant, and they deliver a lady into your possession:
but I have no quarrel with them, since they have
put me into so good hands.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  I now proclaim a solemn suspension of arms
between medicine and diseases. Let distempers suspend
their malignant influence, and powders, pills, and
potions their operations. Be this day sacred to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
love. I had rather hold this hand of thine, than a
dutchess by the pulse.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  And I this, than a hand of matadores.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Who knows but your relations may dispute
my title to your person? come, my dear, the seal of
the matrimonial bond is consummation.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Alas!  what will become of me!</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Why are thy eyes fix'd on the ground? why
so slow? and why this trembling?</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Ah! heedless creature that I was, to quit
all my relations, and trust myself alone in the hands
of a strange man.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Courage, thou best of my curiosities. Know
that in husband, is comprehended all relations; in
me thou seest a fond father.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Old enough o' my conscience.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  You may, you must trust yourself with me.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Do with me as you please: Yet sure you
cannot so soon forget <a href="#k140_2">the office of the church. Marriage
is not to be undertaken wantonly, like brute
beasts</a>. If you will transgress, the sin be upon your
own head.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Great indeed is thy virtue, and laudable is
thy modesty. Thou art a virgin, and I a philosopher;
but learn, that no animal action, <i>quatenus animal</i>,
is unbecoming of either of us. But hold!
where am I going? Prithee, my dear, of what age
art thou?</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  <a href="#k140_1">Almost three and twenty</a>.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  And I almost at my grand climacterick.
What occasion have I for a double-night at these
years? She may be an Alcmena, but alas! I am no
thunderer.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Aside</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  You seem somewhat disturb'd; I hope you
are well, Mr. Fossile.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  What business have I in the bed-chamber,
when the symptoms of age are upon me? Yet hold,
this is the famous corroborative of Crollius; in this
vial are included sons and daughters. Oh, for a
draught of the <i>aqua magnanimitatis</i> for a vehicle!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fifty drops of <i>liquid laudanum</i> for her dose would but
just put us upon a <i>par</i>. <i>Laudanum</i> would settle the
present ataxy of her animal spirits, and prevent her
being too watchful.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>aside</i></span><br /></p>

<p class="stgdir">Enter a Servant.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> &nbsp;  Sir, your <a href="#k141">pistachoe-porridge</a> is ready.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>


<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Now I think of it, my dear; Venus, which
is in the first degree of Capricorn, does not culminate
till ten; an hour if astrology is not fallible,
successful in generation.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  I am all obedience, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  How shall I reward thee for so much Goodness?
let our wedding as yet be a secret in the
family. In the mean time I'll introduce my niece
Ph&#339;be Clinket to your acquaintance: but alas,
the poor girl has a procidence of the pineal gland,
which has occasioned a rupture in her understanding.
I took her into my house to regulate my oeconomy;
but instead of puddings, she makes pastorals;
or when she should be raising paste, is raising some
ghost in a new tragedy. In short, my house is haunted
by all the underling players, broken booksellers,
half-voic'd singing-masters, and disabled dancing-masters
in town. In a former will I had left her
my estate; but I now resolve that heirs of my own
begetting shall inherit. Yonder she comes in her
usual occupation. Let us mark her a while.</p>

<p class="stgdir1"><i>Enter Clinket and her maid bearing a writing-desk on
her back. Clinket writing, her head dress stain'd
with ink, and pens stuck in her hair.</i></p>

<p><i>Maid.</i>  &nbsp; I had as good carry a raree-show about
the streets. Oh! how my back akes!</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; What are the labours of the back to those
of the brain? thou scandal to the muses. I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
now lost a thought worth a folio, by thy impertinance.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i>  &nbsp; Have not I got a crick in my back already,
that will make me good for nothing, with
lifting your great books?</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Folio's, call them, and not great books,
thou monster of impropriety: But have patience, and
I will remember the three gallery-tickets I promis'd
thee at my new tragedy.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i>  &nbsp; I shall never get my head-cloaths clear-starch'd
at this rate.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Thou destroyer of learning, thou worse
than a book-worm; thou hast put me beyond all patience.
Remember how my lyrick ode bound about
a tallow-candle; thy wrapping up snuff in an epigram;
nay, the unworthy usage of my hymn to Apollo, filthy
creature! read me the last lines I writ upon the
deluge, and take care to pronounce them as I taught
you.</p>

<p>
<i>Maid.</i> &nbsp; Swell'd with a dropsy, sickly nature lies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And melting in a diabetes, dies.</span><br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Reads with an affected tone.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Still without cadence!</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp;  Hold. I conceive&mdash;&mdash;<br />

And whales now perch upon the sturdy oak.<br />
Roaring? stay. Rumbling, roaring, rustling, no; raging seas.           <span class="stgrt">[<i>Writing.</i></span><br />
The raging seas o'er the tall woods have broke,<br />

<p class="noidt">
What feast for fish! Oh too luxurious treat!<br />
When hungry dolphins feed on butchers meat.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Niece, why niece, niece? oh, Melpomene,
thou goddess of tragedy, suspend thy influence for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
moment, and suffer my niece to give me a rational
answer. This lady is a friend of mine; her present
circumstances oblige her to take sanctuary in my
house; treat her with the utmost civility. Let the
tea-table be made ready.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Madam, excuse this absence of mind; my
animal spirits had deserted the avenues of my senses,
and retired to the recesses of the brain, to contemplate
a beautiful idea. I could not force the vagrant
creatures back again into their posts, to move those
parts of the body that express civility.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  A rare affected creature this! if I mistake
not, flattery will make her an useful tool for my purpose.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exeunt</i> Townley, Clinket, <i>and</i> Maid.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Her jewels, her strong box, and all her
things left behind! if her uncle should discover her
marriage, he may lay an embargo upon her goods.&mdash;&mdash;I'll
send for them.</p>

<p class="stgdir">Enter a boy with a letter.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> &nbsp;  This is the ho-ho-house.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  What is your business?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> &nbsp;  A l-l-letter.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Who sent this letter?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> &nbsp;  O-o-one.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Give it me, child. An honest boy. Give
it me, and I'll deliver it myself. A very honest

<p class="center">This from your impatient, R. P.</p></div>

<p>In the name of Beelzebub, what is this? encouragement!
happy to-night! same person! good offices!

<p class="stgdir">Enter <span class="smcap">Townley</span>.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Mrs. Clinket's play is to be read this morning
at the tea-table: will you come and divert yourself,
Sir?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  No: I want to be alone.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  I hope my company is not troublesome already.
I am as yet a bride; not a wife. [<i>sighs.</i>]
What means this sudden change? [<i>Aside.</i>] Consider,
Mr. Fossile, you want your natural rest: the bed
would refresh you. Let me sit by you.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  My head akes, and the bed always makes it
worse.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Is it hereabouts?<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>rubbing his temples.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Too sure.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Turns from her.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Why so fretful, Mr. Fossile?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  No, I'll dissemble my passion, and pump
her. [<i>Aside.</i>] Excess of joy, my dear, for my good
fortune overcomes me. I am somewhat vertiginous,
I can hardly stand.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  I hope I was ordain'd for thy support.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  My disorder now begins to dissipate: it was
only a little flatulency, occasion'd by something hard
of digestion. But pray, my dear, did your uncle
shut you up so close from the conversation of mankind?</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Sarsnet and <a href="#k145">Shock</a> were my only company.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  A very prudent young woman this Sarsnet;
she was undoubtedly a good and faithful friend in
your solitude.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  When it was her interest; but I made no
intimacies with my chamber-maid.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  But was there no lover offer'd his service to
a lady in distress.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Tongue, be upon thy guard: these questions
must be design'd to trap me. [<i>Aside.</i>] A woman
of my condition can't well escape importunity.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  What was the name of that disagreeable fellow,
who, you told me, teaz'd you so?</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  His name? I think he had a thousand
names. In one letter he was Myrtillo, in another
Corydon, Alexis, and I don't know what.</p>

<p class="stgdir">Enter <span class="smcap">Sarsnet</span> in haste to her mistress: He runs and
embraces her with great earnestness.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Dear Mrs. Sarsnet, how am I oblig'd to thee
for thy services: thou hast made me happy beyond
expression.&mdash;&mdash;I shall find another letter upon
her.<br />

business.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Fossile gets between Sarsnet and Townley.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Ptis.</i> &nbsp;  Lady Varnish finds no benefit of the waters;

of Hippokekoana. The emetick has over-wrought
and she is in convulsions.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  This is unfortunate. Then I must go. Mr.

and a dream demonstration. A civil letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
makes him thoughtful, an innocent visit mad. I
shall try you, Mr. Fossile; for don't think I'll be deny'd
company.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Nay, prithee, my dear; I own I have abused
thee. But lest my marriage, and this simple
story should take air in the neighbourhood, to morrow
we will retire into the country together, till the
secret is blown over. I am call'd to a patient. In
less than half an hour I'll be with you again, my
dear.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exit Fossile.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Plotwell's letter had like to have ruin'd
me. 'Twas a neglect in me, not to intrust him with
the secret of my marriage. A jealous bridegroom!
every poison has its antidote; as credulity is the
cause, so it shall be the cure of his jealousy. To
morrow I must be spirited away into the country; I'll
immediately let Plotwell know of my distress: and
this little time with opportunity, even on his wedding-day,
shall finish him a compleat husband. Intrigue
assist me! and I'll act a revenge that might
have been worthy the most celebrated wife in Boccace.</p>

<p class="stgdir">Enter <span class="smcap">Plotwell</span> and <span class="smcap">Clinket</span>.</p>

<p class="noidt">Hah! Plotwell! which way got he hither? I must
caution him to be upon his guard.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Madam, I am agreeably surpriz'd to find
you here.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Me, Sir? you are certainly mistaken, for
I don't remember I ever saw you before.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Madam, I beg your pardon. How like a
truth sounds a lye from the tongue of a fine woman.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>


<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; This, Madam, is Mr. Plotwell; a Gentleman
who is so infinitely obliging, as to introduce
my play on the theatre, by fathering the unworthy
issue of my muse, at the reading it this morning.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  I should be proud, madam, to be a real father
to any of your productions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Mighty just. Ha, ha, ha. You know,
Mr. Plotwell, that both a parrot and a player can utter
human sounds, but we allow neither of them to be
a judge of wit. Yet some of those people have had
the assurance to deny almost all my performances the
privilege of being acted. Ah! what a <i>Go&ucirc;t de travers</i>
rules the understanding of the illiterate!</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  There are <a href="#k150">some, madam, that nauseate the
smell of a rose</a>.</p>

<p class="stglt">[<i>Whenever Plotwell and Townley endeavour to
talk, she interrupts them.</i></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; If this piece be not rais'd to the sublime,
let me henceforth be stigmatiz'd as a reptile in the
dust of mediocrity. I am persuaded, Sir, your adopted
child will do you no dishonour.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Pray, madam, what is the subject?</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Oh! beyond every thing. So adapted for
tragical machines! so proper to excite the passions!
not in the least encumber'd with episodes! the vraysemblance
and the miraculous are linkt together with
such propriety.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  But the subject, madam?</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; The universal Deluge, I chose that of
Deucalion and Pyrrha, because neither our stage nor
actors are hallow'd enough for sacred story.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  But, madam&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>To Townley.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; What just occasion for noble description!
these players are exceeding dilatory.</p>

<p class="noidt">&mdash;In the mean time, Sir, shall I be oblig'd to you
and this lady for the rehearsal of a scene that I have
been just touching up with some lively strokes.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  I dare assure you, madam, it will be a
pleasure to us both.  I'll take this occasion to inform
you of my present circumstances.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>To Plotwell.</i></span><br /></p>


<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Imagine Deucalion and Pyrrha in their
boat. They pass by a promontory, where stands
prince H&aelig;mon a former lover of Pyrrah's, ready to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
be swallowed up by the devouring flood. She presses
her husband to take him into the boat. Your part,
Sir, is H&aelig;mon; the lady personates Pyrrha; and I
represent Deucalion. To you, Sir.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Gives Plotwell the manuscript.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  What ho, there sculler!<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>reads.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;    &mdash;&mdash;H&aelig;mon!</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;   &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Yes, 'tis H&aelig;mon!</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Thou seest me now sail'd from my former lodgings,<br />
Beneath a husband's ark; yet fain I would reward<br />
Thy proffer'd love. But H&aelig;mon, ah, I fear<br />
Tomorrow's eve will hide me in the country.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Not a syllable in the part! wrong, all
wrong!</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Through all the town, with diligent enquiries,<br />
I sought my Pyrrha&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Beyond all patience! the part, Sir, lies
before you; you are never to perplex the drama with
speeches extempore.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Madam, 'tis what the top players often do.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Though love denies, companion bids me
save thee.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Plotwell kisses her.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Fye, Mr. Plotwell; this is against all the
decorum of the stage; I will no more allow the libertinism
of lip-embraces than the barbarity of killing
on the stage; your best tragedians, like the ladies
of quality in a visit, never turn beyond the back-part
of the cheek to a salute, as thus Mr. Plotwell.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Kisses Plotwell.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  I don't find in Aristotle any precept against
killing.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Yet I would not stand upon the brink of
an indecorum.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  True, madam, the finishing stroke of love
and revenge should never shock the eyes of an audience.
But I look upon a kiss in a comedy to be upon
a par with a box on the ear in a tragedy, which is frequently
given and taken by your best authors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i> &nbsp; Mighty just! for a lady can no more put
up a kiss than a gentleman a box on the ear.<br />
Take my muse, Sir, into your protection [<i>Gives him
her play</i>] the players I see are here. Your personating
the author will infallibly introduce my play on
the stage, and spite of their prejudice, make the theatre
ring with applause, and teach even <a href="#k152">that injudicious
Canaille</a> to know their own interest.<br />

<h3>ACT II.</h3>


<p class="stgdir1"><span class="smcap">Plotwell</span>, <span class="smcap">Townley</span>, <span class="smcap">Clinket</span>, with Sir
<span class="smcap">Tremendous</span> and two Players, discovered seated
round a Table.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Gentlemen, this lady who smiles on my
performances, has permitted me to introduce you and
my tragedy to her tea-table.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Gentlemen, you do me honour.</p>

<p>1st <i>Play.</i> &nbsp; Suffer us, Sir, to recommend to your
acquaintance, the famous Sir Tremendous, the greatest
critick of our age.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Sir Tremendous, I rejoice at your presence;
though no lady that has an antipathy, so sweats at a cat
as some authors at a critick. Sir Tremendous, madam,
is a Gentleman who can instruct the town to dislike
what has pleased them, and to be pleased with
what they disliked.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp; Alas! what signifies one good palate
when the taste of the whole town is viciated. There
is not in all this Sodom of ignorance ten righteous
criticks, who do not judge things backward,</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; I perfectly agree with Sir Tremendous:
your modern tragedies are such egregious stuff, they
neither move terror nor pity.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Yes, madam, the pity of the audience on the
first night, and the terror of the author for the third.
Sir Tremendous's plays indeed have rais'd a sublimer
passion, astonishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; I perceive here will be a wit-combat between
these beaux-esprits. Prue, be sure you set down
all the similes.</p>

<p class="stgdir1"><i>Prue retires to the back part of the stage with pen
and ink.</i></p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp;  The subjects of most modern plays are
as ill chosen as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Plotw.</i> &nbsp;  The patrons of their dedications.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Clink. makes signs to Prue.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp;  Their plots as shallow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Plotw.</i>  &nbsp; As those of bad poets against new plays</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp;  Their episodes as little of a piece to
the main action, as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; A black gown with a pink-colour'd petticoat.
Mark that, Prue.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp;  Their sentiments are so very delicate&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Plotw.</i>  &nbsp; That like whipt syllabub they are lost before
they are tasted.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>  &nbsp; Their diction so low, that&mdash;that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Plotw.</i>  &nbsp;  Why, that their friends are forced to call
it simplicity.</p>

<p>1st <i>Play.</i>  &nbsp;  Sir to the play if you please.</p>

<p>2d <i>Play.</i>   &nbsp; We have a rehearsal this morning.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>  &nbsp;  And then their thefts are so open&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Plotw.</i>  &nbsp;  that the very French taylors can discover
them.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>  &nbsp;  O what felony from the ancients! what
petty larceny from the moderns! there is the famous
Ephigenia of Racine, he stole his Agamemnon
from Seneca, who stole it from Euripides, who
stole it from Homer, who stole it from all the
ancients before him. In short there is nothing so
execrable as our most taking tragedies.</p>

<p>1st <i>Play.</i>  &nbsp;   O! but the immortal Shakespeare, Sir.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>  &nbsp;  He had no judgnent.</p>

<p>2d <i>Play.</i>  &nbsp;  The famous ben Johmson!</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Mere chit-chat.</p>

<p>1st <i>Play.</i>  &nbsp;  Dryden!</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>  &nbsp;  Nothing but a knack of versifying.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Ah! dear Sir Tremendous, there is that
delicatesse in your sentiments!</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>  &nbsp;  Ah madam! there is that justness in your
notions!</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; I am so much charm'd with your manly penetration!</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>  &nbsp;  I with your profound capacity!</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>   &nbsp;  That I am not able&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>  &nbsp;  That it is impossible&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp;  To conceive&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>   &nbsp; To express&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp;  With what delight I embrace&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>   &nbsp; With what pleasure I enter into&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Your ideas, most learned Sir Tremendous!</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i>  &nbsp;  Your sentiments, most divine Mrs.
Clinket.</p>

<p>2d <i>Play.</i>  &nbsp;  The play, for heaven's sake, the play.</p>

<p class="stgdir">[<i>A tea-table brought in.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; This finish'd drama is too good for an
age like this.</p>

<p><i>Plotw.</i>   &nbsp; The Universal Deluge, or the tragedy of
Deucalion and Pyrrha.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Reads</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp;  Mr. Plotwell, I will not be deny'd the
pleasure of reading it, you will pardon me.</p>

<p>1st <i>Play.</i>  &nbsp;  The deluge! the subject seems to be
too recherche.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; A subject untouch'd either by ancients or
moderns, in which are terror and pity in perfection.</p>

<p>1st <i>Play.</i>  &nbsp;  The stage will never bear it. Can you
suppose, Sir, that a box of ladies will sit three hours
to see a rainy day, and a feather in a storm; make
your best of it, I know it can be nothing else.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>2d <i>Play.</i>   &nbsp; If you please, madam, let us hear how
it opens.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; [<i>reads.</i>] &nbsp; The scene opens and discovers the
heavens cloudy. A prodigious shower of rain. At a
distance appears the top of the mountain Parnassus; all
the fields beneath are over-flowed; there are seen cattle
and men swimming. The tops of steeples rise above
the flood, with men and women perching on
their weathercocks&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp; Begging your pardon, Sir, I believe it
can be proved, that weather-cocks are of a modern
invention. Besides, <a href="#k156">if stones were dissolved, as a late
philosopher hath proved</a>, how could steeples stand?</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  I don't insist upon trifles. Strike it out.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Strike it out! consider what you do. In
this they strike at the very foundation of the drama.
Don't almost all the persons of your second act start
out of stones that Deucalion and Pyrrha threw behind
them? This cavil is levell'd at the whole system of
the reparation of human race.</p>

<p>1st <i>Play.</i> &nbsp; Then the shower is absurd.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Why should not this gentleman rain, as
well as other authors snow and thunder?&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
[<i>reads.</i>] Enter Deucalion in a sort of waterman's habit,
leading his wife Pyrrha to a boat&mdash;Her first distress
is about her going back to fetch a casket of jewels.
Mind, how he imitates your great authors.
The first speech has all the fire of Lee.</p>

<p class="poem">
Tho' heav'n wrings all the sponges of the sky,<br />
And pours down clouds, at once each cloud a sea.<br />
Not the spring tides&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp; There were no spring tides in the Mediteranean,
and consequently Deucalion could not
make that simile.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; A man of Deucalion's quality might have
travelled beyond the Mediteranean, and so your objection
is answered. Observe, Sir Tremendous, the
tenderness of Otway, in this answer of Pyrrha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Why do the stays<br />
Taper my waist, but for thy circling arms?<br />
</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp; Ah! Anachronisms! Stays are a modern
habit, and the whole scene is monstrous, and against
the rules of tragedy.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  I submit Sir,&mdash;out with it.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Were the play mine, you should gash my
flesh, mangle my face, any thing sooner than scratch
my play.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Blot and insert wherever you please&mdash;&mdash;I
submit myself to your judgment.</p>

<p class="stgdir"><i>Plotwell rises and discourses apart with Townley.</i></p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp; Madam, nonsense and I have been at
variance from my cradle, it sets my understanding on
edge.</p>

<p>2d <i>Play.</i> &nbsp; Indeed, madam, with submission, and
I think I have some experience of the stage, this play
will hardly take.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; The worst lines of it would be sufficiently
clapt, if it had been writ by a known author, or recommended
by one.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp; Between you and I, madam, who understand
better things, this gentleman knows nothing
of poetry.</p>

<p>1st <i>Play.</i> &nbsp; The gentleman may be an honest man,
but he is a damn'd writer, and it neither can take,
nor ought to take.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Trem.</i> &nbsp; If you are the gentleman's friend, and
value his reputation, advise him to burn it.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; What struggles has an unknown author to
vanquish prejudice! Suppose this play acts but six
nights, his next may play twenty. Encourage a
young author, I know it will be your interest.</p>

<p>2d <i>Play.</i> &nbsp; I would sooner give five hundred pounds
than bring some plays on the stage; an audience little
considers whether 'tis the author or the actor that
is hiss'd, our character suffers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>1st <i>Play.</i> &nbsp; Damn our character&mdash;We shall lose money
by it.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; I'll deposit a sum myself upon the success
of it. Well, since it is to be play'd&mdash;I will prevail
upon him to strike out some few things.&mdash;Take the
play, Sir Tremendous.</p>

<p class="stgdir"><i>Sir Tremendous reads in a muttering tone.</i></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  O marriage, thou bitterest of potions, and
thou strongest of astringents. This Plotwell that I
found talking with her must certainly be the person
that sent the letter. But if I have a Bristol stone put
upon me instead of a diamond, why should I by experiments
spoil its lustre? She is handsome, that is
certain. Could I but keep her to myself for the future!
Cuckoldom is an accute case, it is quickly over;
when it takes place, it admits of no remedy but palliatives.&mdash;&mdash;Be

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  A Special dog; this footman of my wife's!
as mercenary as the porter of a first minister!
Why should she place him as a centinal at my
door? unquestionably, to carry on her intrigues.
Why did I bribe him to lend me his livery? to discover
those intrigues. And now, O wretched Fossile,
thou hast debas'd thyself into the low character of a
footman. What then? gods and demi gods have assum'd
viler shapes: they, to make a cuckold; I, to
prove myself one. Why then should my metamorphosis
be more shameful, when my purpose is more
honest?</p>

<p><i>Foot.</i> &nbsp; Ay, this is her livery. Friend, give this to

you as a mistress.<br />
<span class="stgrt">'Charles Bat.'</span><br /></p>

<p>Why did I part with this fellow? This was a proposal
indeed, to make both me and himself happy at
once! He shall have her, and a twelve-month's fees
into the bargain. Where shall I find him?&mdash;Why
was the mistress of all mankind unknown to thee alone?
Why is nature so dark in our greatest concerns?
Why are there no external symptoms of defloration,
nor any pathognomick of the loss of virginity but a
big belly? Why has not lewdness its tokens like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>

corns, and have no prognostick of what is of infinitely
greater moment, cuckoldom? Or if there are any marks
of chastity, why is the enquiry allowed only to Turks
and Jews, and denyed to Christians? O Townley,
Townley! once to me the fragrant rose; now aloes,
wormwood and snake-root! but I must not be seen.</p>

<p class="stgdir"><i>As Townley and Sarsnet enter, Fossile sneaks off.</i></p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Sarsnet, we are betray'd. I have discovered
my husband posted at the door in Hugh's
livery, he has intercepted all my letters. I immediately
writ this, which is the only thing that can
bring us off. Run this moment to Plotwell, get
him to copy it, and send it directed to me by his
own servant with the utmost expedition. He is now
at the chocolate-house in the next street.</p>

<p><i>Sars.</i> &nbsp; I fly, madam; but how will you disengage
yourself from the affair with Underplot?</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Leave it to me. Though he wants sense,
he's handsome, and I like the fellow; and if he is
lucky enough to come in my husband's absence.&mdash;&mdash;But
prithee Sarsenet make haste.</p>

<p class="stgdir">[<i>Exit Townley and Sarsenet, upon which Fossile

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; Harke'e, friend. I never talk with one
of your coat, but I first tip him.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Behold the lucre of a pimp! Between the pox
abroad, and my plague at home, I find a man may
never want fees. [<i>aside.</i>] Your honour's commands,
I pray. I long to serve you.</p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; Ah, boy! thou hast a rare mistress for vails.
Come I know thou art a sly dog; can'st thou introduce
me to her for a moment's conversation?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Impossible.</p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; What, still impossible?<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Gives more money.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Still impossible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; Poh, pox. But prithee, friend, by the
by, is there any thing in this report that she is marry'd
to the doctor here?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  I am afraid there is something in it.</p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; What a spirit does a jealous husband give
to an intrigue! Pray, is he not a most egregious silly
animal?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Not exceeding wise indeed,</p>

<p><i>Underp,</i> &nbsp; Rich?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  He has money.</p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; That will save the expence of her gallants.
Old?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Ay, too old, heaven knows.</p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; How came it into the puppy's head to
marry?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  By the instigation of Satan.</p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; I'll help the old fool to an heir.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  No doubt on't. If the whole town can do it,
he will not want one.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; Come, prithee deal freely with me, Has
Plotwell been here since the wedding?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  He has! too sure: [<i>aside.</i>] He's a dangerous
rival to you; if you have a mind to succeed,
keep a strict watch upon him, that he may not get
admittance before you.</p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; Well since thou hast shown thyself so
much my friend, I'll let thee into a secret. Plotwell
and I no sooner heard of the wedding, but we
made a bett of a hundred guineas, who should dub
the doctor first. Remember you go twenty pieces
with me.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  But here is some body coming. Away you
are sure of my interest.<br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exit Underplot.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  This was well judg'd. I have a small territory
coveted by two rival potentates. It is profound
policy to make them watch one the other, and so
keep the ballance of power in my own hands. Certainly
nothing so improves one's politicks, as to have
a coquet to on'es wife,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p class="stgdir">Enter a footman with a letter,</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp; [<i>reads.</i>] &nbsp; 'Know, cruel woman, I have discovered
the secret of your marriage; you shall

without the pleasure of giving him cause. I
have this morning counterfeited billetdoux and

some of which, I hope, are fallen into your
old coxcomb's hands. If you deny me the

'We only know, that we know nothing.' The eruption
of those horns which seem'd to make so strong
a push is now suppress'd. Is the mystery of all these
letters nothing but the revenge of a disappointed lover?
The hand and seal are just the same with the Welchman's
that I intercepted a while ago. Truly, these
Welch are a hot revengeful people. My wife may
be virtuous; she may not. Prevention is the safest
method with diseases and intrigues. Women are wanton,
husbands weak, bawds busy, opportunities dangerous,
gallants eager; therefore it behoves honest men
to be watchful. But here comes my Wife, I must
hide myself; for should I be detected, she might have
a just cause of complaint for my impertinent curiosity.<br />

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Pray, Sir, what university are you of?</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  De famous university of Cracow in Polonia

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  By calcination; reverberation; purification;
sublimation; amalgamation; precipitation; volitilization.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Have a care what you assert. The volitilization
of gold is not an obvious process. It is by
great elegance of speech called, <i>fortitudo fortitudinis
fortissima</i>.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  I need not acquaint de illustrious doctor
Fossile, dat all de metals be but unripe gold.</p>

But inform me, Sir, what might be your menstruum,
snow-water, or May-dew?</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Snow-vater.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Right. Snow is the universal pickle of nature

hyemal season.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  If you will go your self, and not trust de

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Perhaps you might. I am not at present

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  This bite wont take to send him out of the
way, I'll change my subject. [<i>Aside.</i>] Do you deal in
longitudes, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  I deal not in impossibilities. I search only
for the grand elixir.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  This is all out of my way. Do you know

shells, bones, and vegetables?</p>

spoon, and fork, with the mark of Tubal Cain in
Hebrew, dug out of the mine of Babylon?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Of what dimensions, I pray, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  De spoon be bigger dan de modern ladle;
de fork, like de great fire-fork; and de knife, like

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Bless me! this shows the stature and magnitude

de businss vil not let me.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  An extraordinary man this! I'll examine
him further. [<i>Aside.</i>] How could your country lose so
great a man as you?</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Dat be de secret. But because me vil have
de fair correspondence with de illustrious doctor Fossile,
me vil not deny dat Orpheus and me had near
run de same fate for different reason. I was hunted
out of my country by de general insurrection of de
women.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  How so pray?</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Because me have prepare a certain liquor
which discover whether a woman be a virgin or no.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  A curious discovery! have you any of it
still?</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Dere it is, Sir. It be commonly called de

<span class="stgrt">[<i>gives him a vial.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  It has the smell of your common hart's-horn.
But all your volatile spirits have a near resemblance.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  Right, Sir. De distillation be made from

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  All together, ah!</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Impossible Sir; but I have an eminent

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exit Hugh. Fossile sits down on a couch.</i></span><br /></p>

out! to watch a wife all day, and have her wake thee
all night! 'twill never do. The <a href="#k178_1">fitigue</a> of three fevers,

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Don't press me, Mr. Fossile, I nauseate it.
It smells strangely. There is something in it.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  An ill symptom! she can't bear the smell.
[<i>aside.</i>]  Pray, my dear, oblige me.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  I'm for none of your flops. I'll fill myself.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  I must own, I have put some restorative drops

<p class="stglt">[<i>Townley drinks. Fossile runs behind to support

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Your insolence is insupportable. 'Twas
but this moment you suspected my virtue; and now
my complexion. Put on your spectacles. No red
was ever laid upon these cheeks. I'll fly thee, and
die a maid, rather than live under the same roof with
jealousy and caprice.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  O thou spotless innocence! I cannot refrain
tears of joy. Forgive me, and I'll tell thee all.
These drops have been a secret in our family for many
years. They are call'd the touch-stone of virginity.
The males administer it to the brides on their wedding-day;
and by its virtue have ascertain'd the honour of
the Fossiles from generation to generation. There
are family customs, which it is almost impious to neglect.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Had you married a person of doubtful reputation&mdash;&mdash;But
me, Mr. Fossile!</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  I did not indeed suspect thee. But my mother
obliged me to this experiment with her dying
words&mdash;My wife is chaste: And to preserve her so,
'tis necessary that I have none but chaste servants about
her. I'll make the experiment on all my female domesticks.
[<i>aside.</i>] I will now, my dear, in thy
presence, put all my family to the trial. Here! bid
my niece, and all the maid-servants come before me.<br />

shame to the world by visible tokens.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; I abominate all kind of drops. They interrupt
the series of ideas. But <a href="#k180">have the any power</a>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  No. They do not affect the <i>motus Primo-primi</i>,

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Then give it me. I can drink as freely of
it as of the waters of Helicon. My love was always

herself a Platonick. You are rather a Cartesian.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Ah dear uncle! how do the Platonicks and
Cartesians differ.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  The Platonicks are for idea's, the Cartesians
for matter and motion.</p>

I will bring thee legs of pullets, remnants of
tarts, and fragments of <a href="#k186_1">desarts</a>. Thou shalt be fed
like Bell and the Dragon.</p>

<p><i>Plot.</i> &nbsp;  But madam; before you entertain me as
your mummy in ordinary, you ought to be acquainted

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp; Much joy to the learned Dr. Fossile. To
have a mummy, an alligator, and a wife, all in one
day, is too great happiness for mortal man!</p>

<p><i>Poss.</i> &nbsp; This an alligator! Alack a day, brother
Nautilus, this is a mere lizard, an eft, a shrimp to
mine.</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp; How improving would it be to the female
understanding, if the closets of the ladies were furnish'd,
or, as I may say, ornamented and embellish'd
with preserv'd butterflies, and beautiful shells, instead
of China jars, and absurd Indian pictures.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Now for a stratagem to bring off my unsuccessful
pair of gallants.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br />
<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exit Townley.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Ah, Dr. Nautilus, how have I languish'd for
your feather of the bird Porphyrion!</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp; But your dart of the Mantichora!</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Your haft of the antediluvian trowel, unquestionably
the tool of one of the Babel masons!</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp; What's that to your fragment of Seth's
pillar?</p>

<p><i>Poss.</i> &nbsp; Gentlemen, I affirm I have a greater curiosity
than all of them. I have an entire leaf of Noah's
journal aboard the ark, that was hewen out of a
porphyry pillar in Palmyra.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Fossile opens the case of the mummy.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp; By the formation of the muscular parts of
the visage, I conjecture that this mummy is male.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; Male, brother! I am sorry to observe your
ignorance of the symetry of a human body. Do but
observe the projection of the hip; besides, the bloom
upon the face; 'tis a female beyond all contradiction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  Let us have no rash dispute, brothers; but
proceed methodically&mdash;&mdash;Behold the vanity of mankind!
[<i>pointing to the mummy.</i>] Some Ptolemy perhaps!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i>  &nbsp; Who by his pyramid and pickle thought to
secure to himself death immortal.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i>  &nbsp; His pyramid, alas! is now but a wainscot
case.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp;  And his pickle can scarce raise him to the
dignity of a collar of brawn.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  Pardon me, Dr. Possum: The mus&aelig;um of
the curious is a lasting monument. And I think it
no degradation to a dead person of quality, to bear
the rank of an anatomy in the learned world.</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp;  By your favour, Dr. Possum, a collar of
brawn! I affirm, he is better to be taken inwardly
than a collar of brawn.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  An excellent medicine! he is hot in the first-degree,
and exceeding powerful in some diseases of
women.</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i>  &nbsp; Right, Dr. Fossile; for your Asphaltion.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp;  Pice-Asphaltus, by your leave.</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp;  By your leave, doctor Possum, I say, Asphaltion.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp;  And I positively say, Pice-Asphaltus.</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp;  If you had read Dioscorides or Pliny&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Poss.</i> &nbsp;  I have read Dioscorides. And I do affirm
Pice-Asphaltus.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Be calm, Gentlemen. Both of you handle
this argument with great learning, judgment, and
perspicuity. For the present, I beseech you to concord,
and turn your speculations on my alligator.</p>

<p><i>Poss.</i> &nbsp;  The skin is impenetrable even to a sword.</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i>  &nbsp; Dr. Possum I will show you the contrary.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Draws his sword.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Poss.</i> &nbsp;  In the mean time I will try the mummy with
this knife, on the point of which you shall smell the

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp;  No phenomenon offers itself to my speculation.</p>

<p><i>Poss.</i>  &nbsp; Point over yonder chimney.  Directly

<p><i>Poss.</i> &nbsp;  First, brother Nautilus, convince yourself

don't walk.</p>

<p><span class="stgrt">[<i>Townley whispers Clinket.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Gentlemen, wonder at nothing within these
walls; for ever since I was married, nothing has
happen'd to me in the common course of human
life.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Madam, without a compliment, you have
a fine imagination. The masquerade of the mummy
and crocodile is extremely just; I would not rob you
of the merit of the invention, yet since you make me
the compliment, I shall be proud to take the whole
contrivance of this masquerade upon myself. [<i>To
Townley.</i>] Sir, be acquainted with my masqueraders.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>To Fossile.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Thou female imp of Appollo, more mischievous
than Circe, who fed gentlemen of the army in
a hog's-stye! What mean you by these gambols? this
mummy, this crocodile?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Only a little mummery, uncle?</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  What an outragious conceit is this! had you
contented yourself with the metamorphosis of Jupiter,
our skill in the classicks might have prevented our
terror.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; I glory in the fertility of my invention the
more, that it is beyond the imagination of a pagan
deity. Besides, it is form'd upon the vraysemblance;
for I know you had a mummy and a crocodile to be
brought home.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  Dr. Nautilus is an infirm tender gentleman;
I wish the sudden concussion of his animal spirits may
not kindle him into a fever. I myself, I must confess,
have an extreme palpitation.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Dear uncle, be pacified. We are both of
us the votaries of our great master Appollo. To you
he has assign'd the art of healing: Me he has taught
to sing; why then should we jangle in our kindred
faculties?</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  Appollo, for ought I know, may be a very
fine person; but this I am very sure of, that the skill
he has given all his physicians is not sufficient to cure
the madness of his poets.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i>  &nbsp; Hark ye, brother Fossile? Your Crocodile
has proved a human creature, I wish your wife may
not prove a crocodile.</p>

<p><i>Naut.</i> &nbsp;  Hark ye, brother Fossile! Your mummy,
as you were saying, seemeth to be hot in the first
degree, and is powerful in some diseases of women.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exit Nautilus and Possum.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  You diabolical performers of my niece's masquerade,
will it please you to follow those gentlemen?</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Nay, Sir, you shall see them dance first.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  Dance! the devil! bring me hither a spit, a
fire-fork, I'll try whether the monsters are impenetrable
or no.</p>

<p><i>Plotw.</i>  &nbsp; I hope, Sir, you will not expose us to the
fury of the mob, since we came here upon so courteous
a design.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Good courteous Mr. Mummy, without more
ceremony, will it please you to retire to your subterraneous
habitation. And you Mr. Crocodile, about
your business this moment, or you shall change your
Nile for the next horse-pond.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Spare my masqueraders.</p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; Let it never be said that the famous Dr.
Fossile, so renowned for his charity to monsters,
should violate the laws of hospitality, and turn a poor
alligator naked into the street.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Deposite your <i>exuvi&aelig;</i> then, and assume your
human shape.</p>

<p><i>Underp.</i> &nbsp; For that I must beg your excuse. A gentleman
would not chuse to be known in these frolicks.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Then out of my doors, here footman, out
with him; out, thou hypocrite, of an alligator.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Underplot is turn'd out.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>Sir, the respect I have for catacombs and pyramids,
will not protect you.<br />

<p class="stgdir">Enter <span class="smcap">Prue</span>.</p>

<p><i>Prue.</i> &nbsp; Sir, Sir, lock your doors, or else all your

<p><i>Foot.</i> &nbsp; The herbwoman swore she knew him to be

Pulchre's church-yard; then the monster call'd a
coach, methought with the voice of a christian; but
a sailor that came by said he might be a crocodile for
all that, for crocodiles could cry like children, and
was for killing him outright, for they were good to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>

<p><i>Prue.</i> &nbsp; Then he was hurry'd a way by the mob. A
bull-dog ran away with fix joints of his tail, and the
claw of his near foot before: At last by good fortune,
to save his life, he fell in with the Hockley in the
Hole bull and bear; the master claim'd him for his
monster, and so he is now attended by a vast mob, very
solemnly marching to Hockley in the Hole, with the
bear in his front, the bull in his rear, and a monkey
upon each shoulder.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;   Mr. Mummy, you had best draw the curtains
of your chair, or the mob's respect for the dead
will scarce protect you.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exit Plotwell in a chair.</i></span><br /></p>

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exit Clinket.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Fos.</i>  &nbsp; Sweetly, Horace. <i>Nunquam satis</i>, and so

have been married?</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Near three hours, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  And what anxieties has this time produc'd?
the dangers of divorce! calumniatory letters! lewd
fellows introduc'd by my niece! groundless jealousies
on both sides! even thy virginity put to the touch-stone!
but this last danger I plung'd thee in myself;
to leave thee in the room with two such robust young
fellows.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Ay, with two young fellows! but my
dear, I know you did it ignorantly.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  This is the first blest minute of repose that
I have enjoy'd in matrimony. Dost thou know the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
reason, my dear, why I have chosen thee of all womankind?</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  My face, perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  No.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  My wit?</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  No.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  My virtue and good humour.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  No. But for the natural conformity of our
constitutions. Because thou art hot and moist in the
third degree, and I myself cold and dry in the first.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  And so nature has coupled us like the elements.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  Thou hast nothing to do but to submit thy
constitution to my regimen.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  You shall find me obedient in all things.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  It is strange, yet certain, that the intellects
of the infant depend upon the suppers of the parents.
Diet must be prescrib'd.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  So the wit of one's posterity is determin'd
by the choice of one's cook.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;   Right. You may observe how French
cooks, with their high ragousts, have contaminated
our plain English understandings. Our supper to

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Call the man back. If you have committed
one folly, don't expose yourself by a second.</p>

<p><i>Sail.</i> &nbsp; The gentlewoman says well. Come, master,
we all know that there is no boarding a pretty
wench, without charges one way or other; you are a
doctor, master, and have no surgeons bills to pay;
and so can the better afford it.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Rather than you should bring a scandal on
your character, I will submit to be a kind mother-in-law.</p>

<p class="stgdir">Enter Justice Possum, and Clerk.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  Mr. justice Possum, for now I must so call
you, not brother Possum; here is a troublesome fellow
with a child, which he would leave in my
house.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp;  Another man's child? he cannot in law.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp;  It seemeth to me to be a child unlawfully
begotten.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; A bastard! who does he lay it to?</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp; To our family.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; Your family, <i>quatenus</i> a family, being a body
collective, cannot get a bastard. Is this child a bastard,
honest friend?</p>

<p><i>Sail.</i> &nbsp; I was neither by when his mother was
show'd, nor when she was unladen; whether he belong
to a fair trader, or be run goods, I cannot tell:
In short here I was sent, and here I will leave him.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; Dost then know his mother, friend?</p>

<p><i>Sail.</i> &nbsp;  I am no midwife, master; I did not see him
born.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; You had best put up this matter, doctor. A
man of your years, when he has been wanton, cannot
be too cautious.</p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp; This is all from the purpose. I was married
this morning at seven; let any man in the least acquainted
with the powers of nature, judge whether
that human creature could be conceiv'd and brought
to maturity in one forenoon.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; This is but talk, doctor Fossile. It is well
for you, though I say it, that you have fallen into the
hands of a person, who has study'd the civil and canon
law in the point of bastardy. The child is either
yours or not yours.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  My child, Mr. Justice!</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; Look ye, doctor Fossile, you confound filiation
with legitimation. Lawyers are of opinion,
that filiation is necessary to legitimation, but not <i>&egrave;
contra</i>.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>The child cries</i></span><br /></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  I would not starve any of my own species,
get the infant some water-pap. But Mr. Justice&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; The proofs, I say, doctor, of filiation are
five. Nomination enunciatively pronounc'd, strong
presumptions, and circumstantial proofs&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  What is all this to me? I tell you I know
nothing of the child.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; Signs of paternal piety, similitude of features,
and commerce with the mother. And first of
the first, nomination. Has the doctor ever been
heard to call the infant, son?</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  He has call'd him child, since he came into
this room. You have indeed, Mr. Fossile.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; Bring hither the doctor's great bible.&mdash;&mdash;Let
us examine in the blank leaf whether he be enroll'd
among the rest of his children.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  I tell you, I never had any children. I shall
grow distracted, I shall&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; But did you give any orders against registring
the child by the name of Fossile?</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  How was it possible?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; Set down that, clerk. He did not prohibit
the registring the child in his own name. We our
selves have observed one sign of fatherly tenderness;
clerk, set down the water-pap he order'd just now.
<a href="#k199">Come we may</a>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  What a jargon is this!</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; Come we now, I say, to that which the
lawyers call <i>magnum natur&aelig; argumentum</i>, similitude
of features. Bring hither the child, friend; Dr.
Fossile, look upon me. The unequal circle of the
infant's face, somewhat resembles the inequality of
the circumference of your countenance; he has also
the vituline or calf-like concavity of the profile of
your visage.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Pish.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; And he is somewhat beetle-brow'd, and his
nose will rise with time to an equal prominence with
the doctor's.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Indeed he has somewhat of your nose Mr.
Fossile.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Ridiculous!</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  The child is comely.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp; Consider the large aperture of his mouth.</p>

<p><i>Sail.</i> &nbsp; Nay, the tokens are plain enough. I have
the fellow of him at home; but my wife told me
two days ago, that this with the wall-eye and splay-foot
belong'd to you, Sir.</p>

<p class="stglt">[<i>Prue runs a-cross the stage with a letter, which
Fossile snatches from her.</i></p>

<p><i>Fos.</i> &nbsp; Whither are you going so fast, hussy? I will
examine every thing within these walls. [<i>Exit Prue.</i>]<br />
[<i>reads.</i>] &nbsp; 'For Richard Plotwell, esq;' This letter

</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;As you say, doctor, the case is too plain; every
circumstance hits.</p>

<p class="stgdir">Enter <span class="smcap">Clinket</span>.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; 'Tis very uncivil, Sir, to break open one's
letters.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Would I had not; and that the contents of
it had been a secret to me and all mankind for ever.
Wretched creature, to what a miserable condition has
thy poetry reduc'd thee!</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; I am not in the least mortified with the accident.
I know it has happen'd to many of the most
famous daughters of Apollo; and to myself several
times.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  I am thunderstruck at her impudence! several
times!</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; I have had one returned upon my hands every
winter for these five years past. I may perhaps be
excell'd by others in judgment and correctness of manners,
but for fertility and readiness of conception, I
will yield to nobody.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Bless me, whence had she this luxuriant
constitution!</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp;  Patience, Sir. Perhaps the lady may be
married.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  Tis infamous, Mr. Fossile, to keep her in
your house; yet though you turn her out of doors,
use her with some humanity; I will take care of the
child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; I can find no <i>Deno&uuml;ement</i> of all this conversation.
Where is the crime, I pray, of writing a
tragedy? I sent it to Drury-Lane house to be acted;
and here it is return'd by the wrong go&ugrave;t of the
actors.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp;  This incident has somewhat embarrassed us.
But what mean you here, madam, by this expression?
Your offspring.</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; My tragedy, the offspring of my brain.
One of his majesty's justices of the peace, and not
understand the use of the metaphor!</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp;  Doctor, you have used much artifice, and
many demurrers; but the child must lie at your door
at last. Friend, speak plain what thou knowest of
this matter.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Let me relate my story. This morning, I
married this lady, and brought her from her lodgings,
at Mrs. Chambers's, in King-street, Covent-Garden.</p>

<p><i>Sail.</i> &nbsp;  Mrs. Chambers! To that place I was directed,
where liv'd the maid that put the bantling out
to be nurs'd by my wife for her lady; and who she
was, 'tis none of our business to enquire.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i> &nbsp;  Dost thou know the name of this maid?</p>

<p><i>Sail.</i> &nbsp;  Let me consider&mdash;&mdash;Lutestring.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Sarsnet, thou mean'st.</p>

<p><i>Sail.</i>  &nbsp; Sarsnet, that's right.</p>

<p><i>Town.</i> &nbsp;  I'll turn her out of my house this moment,
Filthy creature!</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i>  &nbsp; The evidence is plain. You have cohabitation
with the mother, doctor, <i>currat lex</i>. And you
must keep the child.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Your decree is unjust, Sir, and I'll seek my
remedy at law. As I never was espoused, I never had
carnal knowledge of any woman; and my wife,
Mrs. Susanna Townley, is a pure virgin at this hour
for me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pos.</i>  &nbsp; Susanna Townley! Susannah Townley!
Look how runs the warrant you drew up this morning.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Clerk gives him a paper.</i></span><br />

Madam, a word in private with you. [<i>whispers</i> her]
Doctor, my Lord Chief Justice has some business
with this lady.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  My Lord Chief Justice business with my
wife!</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i>  &nbsp; To be plain with you, doctor Fossile, you
have for these three hours entertain'd another man's
wife. Her husband, lieutenant Bengal, is just returned
from the Indies, and this morning took out a
warrant from me for an elopement; it will be more
for your credit to part with her privately, than to
suffer her publickly to be carried off by a tipstaff.</p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  Surprizing have been the events of this day;
but this, the strangest of all, settles my future repose.
Let her go&mdash;I have not dishonoured the bed of lieutenant
Bengal&mdash;Hark ye friend! Do you follow her
with that badge of her infamy.</p>

<p><i>Pos.</i>  &nbsp; By your favour, doctor, I never reverse my
judgment. The child is yours: for it cannot belong
to a man who has been three years absent in the East-Indies.
Leave the child.</p>

<p><i>Sail.</i>  &nbsp; I find you are out of humour, master. So
I'll call to-morrow for his clearings.</p>

<p class="stgdir">[<i>Sailor lays down the child, and exit with Possum,
Clerk, and Townley.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Clink.</i>  &nbsp; Uncle, by this day's adventure, every one
has got something. Lieutenant Bengal has got his
wife again; you a fine child; and I a plot for a comedy;
and I'll this moment set about it.<br />

<span class="stgrt">[<i>Exit Clinket.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Foss.</i> &nbsp;  What must be, must be. [<i>takes up the
child.</i>] Fossile, thou didst want posterity: Here behold
thou hast it. A wife thou didst not want; thou
hast none. But thou art caressing a child that is not
thy own. What then? a thousand, and a thousand
husbands are doing the same thing this very
instant; and the knowledge of truth is desirable, and
makes thy case the better, What signifies whether
a man beget his child or not? How rediculous is the
act itself, said the great emperor Antoninus! I now
look upon myself as a Roman citizen; it is better
that the father should adopt the child, than that the
wife should adopt the father.<br />

<i>The ancient Epilogue, as criticks write,<br />
Was, Clap your hands, excuse us, and good-night.<br />
The modern always was a kind essay<br />
To reconcile the audience to the play:<br />
More polish'd, we of late have learn'd to fly<br />
At parties, treaties, nations, ministry.<br />
Our author more genteelly leaves these brawls<br />
To coffee-houses, and to coblers stalls.<br />
His very monsters are of sweet condition,<br />
None but the Crocodile's a politician;<br />
He reaps the blessings of his double nature,<br />
And, Trimmer like, can live on land or water:<br />
Yet this same monster should be kindly treated,<br />
He lik'd a lady's flesh&mdash;&mdash;but not to eat it.</i></p>

<p>
<i>As for my other spark, my favourite Mummy,<br />
His feats were such, smart youths! as might become ye;<br />
Dead as he seem'd, he had sure signs of life;<br />
His hieroglyphicks pleas'd the doctor's wife.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Whom can our well-bred poetess displease?<br />
She writ like quality&mdash;&mdash;with wond'rous ease:<br />
All her offence was harmless want of wit;<br />
Is that a crime?&mdash;&mdash;ye powers, preserve the pit.</i></p>

Yet he was somewhat saucy with his <a href="#k205_2">viol</a>;<br />
What! put young maids to that unnat'ral trial!<br />
So hard a test! why, if you needs will make it,<br />
Faith, let us marry first,&mdash;&mdash;and then we'll take it.</i></p>

And keep as well the mother, as the child!<br />
None but a Tar could be so tender-hearted,<br />
To claim a wife that had been three years parted;<br />
Would you do this, my friends?&mdash;believe me, never!<br />
When modishly you part&mdash;&mdash;you part for ever.</i></p>

My Friend,<br />

<br />
You have sent me a long letter to persuade me
to an undertaking I cannot think myself capable
of executing; therefore, I must call it worse to
me than an Egyptian bondage! My frequenting the
Theatre (you say) I make my favourite amusement&mdash;I
confess it&mdash;I think it a rational, instructive, and
most pleasurable one, of all those this great city affords:
Where can a man pass three hours of his idle
time better? however, I never enter the house as a
critick, and therefore find myself unequal to the task
you have imposed upon me; yet notwithstanding, I
will venture. But as you make use of this old sentence
in your letter,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ut clavis partam, sic pandit Epistol&aelig; pectum.</i></p>

<p class="noidt">I shall divide (as parsons do their pulpit orations) my
matter into three parts. First then I shall give you
my own thoughts, which I believe concur with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
at least three parts of the audience. So I shall unlock
(according to your motto) my breast, and tell
you all I know or think concerning this affair.</p>

<p class="tb">2dly. I intend to let you know as much as I do;
at least, all the persons that are satiriz'd in this merry
drama.</p>

<p class="tb">3dly, And lastly, without the least favour, I
shall discover according to my judgment, from
whence they have borrowed, or bordered upon any
likeness from any other dramatick piece within my
knowledge.</p>

<p class="tb">Now as to the <span class="smcap">First</span> article. The expectation of
all lovers of the drama, were rais'd to the highest
pitch, from the great reputation of the authors, (the
Triumvir, as they were call'd) Pope, Gay, and
Arbuthnot. I went to the Theatre the first night,
but could not find the least room; every door that
was opened to me, diffus'd more heat than a baker's
oven, or the mouth of a glass-house. The next
morning, I stroll'd to several coffee-houses, where I
knew the wits and criticks met like surgeons, to dissect
the body of any new piece; but I found more opinions
among them, than there are sectaries in the
world: So I resolv'd to venture a sweating the next
evening, and be my own judge. When I came to
the Theatre, I found it crowded as the night before,
but fortunately got a seat in the boxes among some of
my acquaintance.</p>

<p>Wilk's spoke the prologue with his usual vivacity and
applause! but he had no sooner ended, and thrown the
fool's cap on the stage,<a name="FNanchor_A_15" id="FNanchor_A_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_15" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> but the storm began, and
the criticks musick of cat-calls join'd in the chorus.&mdash;The
play was acted like a ship tost in a tempest; yet
notwithstanding, through those clouds of confusion
and uproar, I, as one of the neutral powers, could
discover a great many passages that gave me much sa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>tisfaction;
and while the inimitable Oldfield was
speaking the epilogue, (who performed the character
of Mrs. Townley, the doctor's wife) the storm subsided&mdash;And
to speak poetically, my friend&mdash;</p>

<p>The billows seem'd to slumber on the shore.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_15" id="Footnote_A_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_15"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> See the two last lines of the prologue.</p></div>

<p>But when the play was given out for the third night,
(tho' the benefit of the author was not mention'd)
the roar burst out again, like sudden thunder from
two meeting clouds; but I with pleasure observ'd, the
roar of applause overcame and triumph'd.</p>

<p>I went the third night to the pit, where I saw the
comedy perform'd to a numerous and polite audience
with general applause! as for my own particular
part, I was extremely delighted. Thus have I unlock'd
my own sentiments concerning this three hours
after marriage, and expos'd them naked before you.
And so ends the first promised article of my Key&mdash;Now
I shall proceed to the</p>


<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Second</span>, <i>viz.</i> The persons that are struck at in
this drama (which has opened so many mouths against
it) and the cause which drew the satirical lash
upon them.</p>

<p>Poets, that are inspir'd by Apollo are so quickly
fir'd, that the least touch sets them in a blaze. The
Triumvir had been inform'd, that Dr. Fossile, or Dr.
Woodward, which you please; (for Dr. Woodward
they mean by Dr. Fossile) had very concisely affronted
them all three in one speech, <i>viz.</i> Pope's essay on
critiscism, was plundered from Vida&mdash;Gays pastoral
lucubrations, were built upon Spencer, and Brown's
Britania's-pastorals, published in the year 1613&mdash;and
Arbuthnot could never be eminent in surgery, since
he never study'd at Paris or Leyden; for in Scotland,
he could learn nothing, but to cure the itch.
So Fossile appears as the principal character in this ludicrous
drama: He gain'd that title tis said, by
asking a man digging in a gravel-pit&mdash;if he ever met
with any Fossils? the man mistaking the Word, reply'd&mdash;no,
nor Spiggot's master; for I believe this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
gravel-pit was never an ale-cellar yet. Thus have I
given you all the intelligence I can, why Dr Woodward
is Dr. Fossile in this comedy.</p>

<p>The other two physicians next in the dramatis person&aelig;,
do not, I believe, mean any particular persons,
only to satirize pretenders, and you know we have too
many that kill without license.</p>

<p>Sir Tremendous is meant for that snarling, ill-natur'd
critick, Dennis, who fell so critically upon Addison,
with his billingsgate remarks on Cato! a growler,
who never yet lik'd any child of fancy but his
own! and I must declare, all of his offspring that I
have seen, are as ill-shap'd, and as hard-favour'd as
the parent that begot 'em: He swells like an invenom'd
reptile, at any thing that gives pleasure to the
rest of the world, while he only torments himself;
therefore he has truly gain'd the true name of <a href="#k212_2">Heautontimerumenos</a>.</p>

<p>The two extraordinary lovers, Plotwell, and Underplot;
there are so many of their resemblance in
this great town, that we may call them <a href="#k212_1">knights of
the shires, who represent them all</a>.</p>

<p>The two players by their different manner of
speaking, by those whoever convers'd with them,
might be easily found to mean Wilk's and Booth.</p>

<p>Now we have open'd our lock, and set to view all
our men display'd in our three hours after marriage, I
shall proceed to the women, which are but two pointed
at in the drama, whatever may occur in the body
of the play, which I shall refer to the last article of
my discourse. (<i>do not I my friend talk like your chaplain
in the country! on the day between saturday and
monday</i>)?</p>

<p>Mrs. Townley, the heroine of our play, I am
inform'd, does not suit the character of Fossile's real
wife in the least; for tis said they cannot slander that
poor woman with any other failing, than that thing so
much out of fashion call'd virtue; which seems as ridiculous
as if a woman of quality should come to court to
a ball on a birth day, with a black-bever high-crown-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>hat
on: But they say <a href="#k213">another eminent physician's
wife sat for that picture; and the painters have done
her justice in all but the catastrophe; for the poor
man has her still, nor feels he yet any pain in the forehead;
therefore shall be nameless</a>, for I think it hard,
a man's head should be laden, for the lightness of his
wife's heels.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be Clinket; I am a little griev'd to say, reflects
a little on a lady of your acquaintance, the
Countess of W&mdash;&mdash;sea, who is so much affected with
that itch of versifying, that she has implements for
writing, in every room in her house that she frequents.
You and I know, Gay has many obligations
to that lady, therefore, out of justice and good manners
ought to have spar'd her. But poets provok'd,
are as bad as hornets; they care not who they sting!
and I think the motto to the thistle, (the arms of
North-Britain) <i>Nemo me impune lacessit</i>, given by
James V. of Scotland, is not an improper one for a
poet&mdash;That unlucky lady was heard to say,&mdash;<i>Gays
trivia show'd he was more proper to walk before a
chair, than to ride in one</i>. This sarcasm was the
cause, why the poor Countess is thrust among such a
pack of motley figures on the stage. As Hamlet says
by the players; "You had better have a poets good
word, than a bad epitaph after your death." I
must confess a poor revenge upon a woman; and a
revenge of this kind on any of the soft sex, is below
the dignity of man. I am of the poets opinion,
who says&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Too noble for revenge! which still we find<br />
"The weakest frailty of a feeble mind;<br />
"Ungenerous passion! and for man too base&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Thus my friend have I finish'd my 2d article, and
proceed to the <span class="smcap">Third</span> and last, which shall be to
consider the play, and remark every passage that
borders on any other in the dramatic way, but not
with the ill-natur'd design of a critick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The very first scene of the play, puts me in mind
of the first entrance of Morose, with his epic&aelig;ne in
Ben Johnson's silent woman; and several other scenes
in this <i>Three Hours after Marriage</i>, convinces me the
authors had that celebrated comedy often in view.
But Fossile in his first speech where he says&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>I now proclaim a solemn suspension of arms between
medicine and diseases; Be this day sacred to
my love.</i>" Puts me strongly in mind of Jupiter's
ending the first act of Dryden's amphytrion: and I
doubt not, but the author had the same thought
with me.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Let human kind their sovereign's leisure wait,</span><br />
"Love is this night my great affair of state:<br />
"Let this one night on providence be void:<br />
"All Jove for once, is on himself employ'd.<br />
</p>

<p>In the next page Mrs. Townley says&mdash;</p>

<p><i><a href="#k214">Marriage, is not to be undertaken wantonly</a> like brute
beasts.</i> Do you not think this following speech of
Truwits to Morose upon his sudden marriage, was not
the father of Mrs. Townley's speech.</p>

<p>"Wou'd you go to bed so soon? a man of your
head and hair should owe more to the reverend ceremony,
and not mount the marriage-bed like a
town-bull, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The messages from his patients, I like the least of
any thing in the whole play, tho' it is a just satire on
those people of rank, that dare not be well without
the advice of their physician: Yet I am angry at the
countess of Hippokekoana, who is no other than the
good dutchess of M&mdash;n&mdash;th, who generally took an
emetick once a week. This lady had the misfortune
to break her thigh-bone by a fall, but her modesty
was so great, she would not allow the surgeons to apply
any remedy; but by their advice, women took
their office upon them, but performed it so ill, that
the poor lady must go lame to her tomb. The annual
day, on which her illustrious husband lost his head,
she fasts the four and twenty hours: a rare example<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of conjugal-love! But indeed something of this
whole scene may be picked out of <i>Moliere</i>.</p>

<p>In the scene between Tremendous, Clinket and
the Players; that critick talks in the usual stile of
<i>Dennis</i>&mdash;But in this speech of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>There is not in all this sodom of ignorance, ten righteous
criticks</i>&mdash;The triumvir makes a little too free with
the old testament.</p>

<p>Those <a href="#k215_1">letters that are given to the doctor in disguise
of his footman, are something like several passages in
Molier's <i>Cecu imaginaire</i></a>. That sign'd <i>Wyburn</i>, I
believe I need not inform you, is the most noted bawd
in London. The character of <a href="#k215_2">Lubomirski, may be
found (at least something like it) in <i>Lopez de Vega</i></a>; but
his water of virginity, you may find something very
like that in a play call'd the <i>Changeling</i>, written by
Middleton and Rowley in conjunction, printed 1653.</p>

<p>Their Mummy may be found in a little piece in
the <i><a href="#k215_3">Theatre Italien</a></i>, call'd the mummies of Egypt;
and I believe the Nile furnish'd the Crocodile.</p>

<p>I begin to be tir'd my friend, and, therefore let me
tell you, Mrs. Townley proving no wife to Fossile,
may put you in mind of <i>Ben Johnson's</i> silent woman,
and <i>Congreve's</i> old batchelor.</p>

<p>But what of all this! who would search for what I
have done, but such a compliant puppy as myself, to
please one who does not care what trouble I take;
but for taking hints from the French, Spanish, or any
of our own celebrated authors, especially if they are
improved upon, as in justice these are. I will not esteem
a crime&mdash;How many whole plays have we translated
from the celebrated Moliere, that every winter
gives pleasure to a British audience? I shall never ask
my cook of what ingredients my dishes are compos'd,
so my viands are wholsome and well relish'd: And
this Three Hours after Marriage, in my opinion, had
not the satire been pointed at particular people,
might have furnis'd out a repast for many winters
Theatric nights.</p>

<br />

A LETTER, giving an Account of the Origin of
the Quarrel between <i>Cibber</i>, <i>Pope</i>, and <i>Gay</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">SIR</span>,<br />
<br />

You tell me, it is matter of great surprize to
you, that Pope like a vicious horse, has so often
flung out at the Laureat, whose apology for his
life and comedies you so much admire. Women, depend
on it, Sir Thomas, keep up a little vanity, even
in the decline of life, as well as you men; and
you will certainly think so, when I tell you I can unravel
all the true reasons, and sources of that affair.&mdash;I
have often informed you, my intimacy with Mrs.
Oldfield brought me the freedom of the theatre, as
well at rehearsals in the morning, as the use of her box
at night. I accompany'd her almost every morning to the
<i>Three Hours after Marriage</i>. This comedy was the
source of that bitterness, and keen-cutting satire that
Pope expresses against Cibber in all his writings. At
the rehearsal of this piece, no two could express
more amity; and the former was often heard to say,
with his other two associates, Arbuthnot and Gay:
"Cibber, in teaching the comedians their parts,
had struck out infinitely more humour than they
themselves conceiv'd, or even meant; and I
heard Gay say"&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"We dug the oar, but he refin'd the gold."</p>

<p class="noidt">Which was plainly owning, they all three had a hand
in mixing the ingredients for this theatric pudding.</p>

<p>We shall give the first appearance of Pope's resentment,
in Mr. Cibber's own words, in his letter to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Pope; and then relate another passage the laureat has
omitted.</p>

<p>"The play of the Rehearsal, which had lain some
few years dormant, being by his present majesty
(then Prince of Wales) commanded to be reviv'd,
the part of Bayes fell to my share. To this character,
there always had been allow'd such ludicrous liberties
of observation, upon any thing new or remarkable
in the state of the stage, as Mr. Bayes should
think proper to take. Much about this time the
Three Hours after Marriage had been acted, which
Mr. Baye's as usual had a fling at, which in itself
as no jest, unless the audience would please to
make it one. In this play, two coxcombs being
in love with a virtuoso's wife; to get unsuspected
access to her, ingenuously sent themselves as two
presented rarities to the husband, the one swath'd
up like an Egyptian Mummy, and the other sllyly
cover'd in the paste board skin of a Crocodile: Upon
which poetical expedient, Mr. Bayes, when the
two kings of Brentford came down from the clouds
into the throne again; instead of what my part directed
me to say, I made use of these words, <i>viz.</i>
Now Sir, this revolution, I had some thoughts of
introducing by a quite different contrivance; but
my design taking air, some of your sharp wits I
found, had made use of it before me; otherwise, I
intended to have stolen one of them in, in the
shape of a mummy, and the other, in that of a
crocodile. The audience by their roar of applause,
show'd their approbation: But why am I answerable
for that? I did not lead them by any reflection
of my own. But this it seems was so heinously taken
by Mr. Pope, that in the swellings of his
heart after the play was over, he came behind the
scenes with his lips pale, and voice trembling, to
call me to account for the insult, and, accordingly
fell upon me with all the foul language, that a wit
out of his senses, could be capable of&mdash;<i>How durst
I have the impudence to treat any gentlemen in that</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span><i>manner</i>? &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Now let the reader judge by
this concern, who was the true mother of the child&mdash;When
he was almost choak'd with the foam of
his passion, I was enough recovered to make him
(as near as I can remember) this reply&mdash;<i>viz.</i> Mr.
Pope, you <i>are so particular a man, that I must be
asham'd to return your language as I ought to do;
but since you have attacked me in so monstrous a manner,
this you may depend upon, that as long as the
play continues to be acted, I will never fail to repeat
the same words over and over again</i>. Now, as
he accordingly found I kept my word for several
nights following, I am afraid he has since thought,
that his pen was a sharper weapon than his tongue,
to trust his revenge with; and, however just cause
this may be for his doing so; it is, at least, the only
cause my conscience can charge me with.</p>

<p>So far has Mr. Cibber thought fit to relate of this
affair, and no farther, which is strictly true: But the
laureat in this account of the first failing of Mr. Popes
friendship, makes no mention of what pass'd between
him and Mr. Gay, the fourth evening, after his
sparring with Mr. Pope: Perhaps, the death of Gay
prevail'd on him to be silent, or perhaps, that author,
never having publickly attack'd him, might be his
motive for not mentioning the affair.</p>

<p>Thus it was, Mr Pope's frail form not being cut
out for a hero, spirited up Mr. Gay, as a party concerned
in the suppos'd affront; and accordingly, the
fourth night, after Pope's ill success, Gay, like a valiant
champion, came behind the scenes to attack
Bayes at the head of his new rais'd forces: A dangerous
undertaking, since, he might have seen, if rage
had not blinded him, several horse, rang'd on each
side the field of battle, ready for the riders to mount,
at the first call of the trumpet&mdash;most of the forces
were in their tents, waiting the word of command.
But <i>Bayes</i>, the general, already prepar'd, was gone
from his pavilion, and reconnoitring the numerous
spectators&mdash;that is without a metaphor: Cibber with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
his glove rais'd up to his eyes, (his usual custom)
was observing the audience about half an hour after
five o'clock (the play beginning in drury-lane axactly
at six) when Gay accosted him. We shall wave the
short dialogue; but only observe that great poets are
as well vers'd in the vulgar language, as well as the
sublime, and perhaps, in their anger show as little
politeness, as those educated in the boarding school
of billing's-gate. But at last Gays passion grew
ungovernable; he with his arm rais'd high, was going
to discharge a ponderous blow upon Baye's, but
a stander by disarmed him, and prevented the ignominious
blow. They then seiz'd each other, grappled
hard, and a cuff or two were exchang'd on both
sides&mdash;Gay having the advantage of youth, and
strength, threw Bayes down, yet he bravely drag'd
his foe down with him in his fall: But the affair growing
a little too serious, the combatants were parted,
without bloodshed, save that Bayes got a small scratch
upon the nose, which the piece of wet brown paper,
(a property of his part) decently conceal'd from the
spectators. It is certain, one of those that endeavoured
to part them, got a most severe broken shin
from one of them; so that we may be assur'd they
<i>kick'd</i> as well as <i>cuff'd</i>. However this combat did
not last so long as it takes up in the relation. Bayes's
wig went once more under the correction of the barber,
and the play began at the stated time. We cannot
call this by the pompous name of Battle, but
simply skirmishing; but as Gay was obliged to quit
the field, <i>Bayes</i> may in some sort be termed victor;
however, he triumph'd with his mummy and crocodile
that night, but dropt it afterwards, the jest growing
stale. Mr. Pope's apparition to Mr. Cibber on this occasion
was known to very few, but this of Mr. Gay was the
common town and table-talk for some time, kept
up by the grub-street wits that made many a hearty
meal upon it, ('till something more in season threw
it out of the bill of fare.) It is manifest, this truffing
beginning put an end to Pope's friendship for Cibber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
if he realy had any; and the continuance of his enmity,
for near thirty years, is no mark of humanity.
It is accounted unmanly and mean, to give a person
repeated strokes, when he has not spirit enough to resent
the first; and yet that excellent poet, had so much
bitterness in his sweet wit, (if we may be allowed to
say so,) that to many it palls the taste. The reader
in this supplement, will not find Cibber's name once
mentioned: The reason is apparent; he had not done
any thing to provoke; but since the year of the three
Hours after Marriage, (1717) he has a dart at him in
almost every thing he publishes&mdash;In his epistle to doctor
Arbuthnot he plainly says&mdash;(mentioning a play
he was desired to recommend to the stage)</p>

<p class="poem">There (thank my stars) my whole commission ends,<br />
Cibber and I, are luckily no friends.</p>

<p class="noidt">And yet it is well known, Mr. Cibber never made the
least return, till his letter to Pope 1742, and then, he
declar'd to many of his friends, he did it, because he
had no other business on his hands, and that he might
not be forgot before he was dead. Of all the foibles
Mr. Cibber might be guilty of, those that are conversant
with him, know malice, envy or slander, are
not in the composition.</p>

<p>When a person informed him, Pope was no more;
he seem'd much concern'd, and reply'd, I am griev'd
for the loss of so great a man; I was never his enemy,
and for those spots he seem'd to dash on me, his admirable
wit made me overlook them all&mdash;and I am
convinced, he sometimes wrote against the sentiments
of his heart. Nay we are informed, Pope was heard
to say in his last sickness&mdash;</p>

<p>"My satires against Cibber, are not my last repented
faults."</p>

<p>But we are not willing to part with this Three
Hours after Marriage, without relating an odd accident,
that happened the 4th night of that play; it
may be called a scene of distress, in a pantomime that
befell an unlucky lover; for it was all in dumb show:
We are sure, it created more vociferous mirth in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
spectators, than any other passage of wit or satire; and
the enemies to the Triumvir, declared it was the best
thing in the whole piece. Had Hogarth been present
(as he might have been) his inimitable pencil would,
have stronger ideas, of the comic distress, than any
description can do: But, perhaps, contemplating the
scene may strengthen the readers imagination.</p>

<p>Cibber, was the mummy, curiously wrapt and
folded with proper bandages, painted with false Egyptian
Hieroglyphics, but however false the heraldry,
his arms were at liberty. The droll facetious Penkethman,
was that amphibious devourer, the crocodile,
where the painter, the tailor, with other artificers had
us'd their utmost skill: The monster's two foremost
legs, were fitted to his arms, and Penky's legs, serv'd
for those of the monster. He made a formidable figure
as he crawl'd in, with his great head, and long
tail; for, tho' he was ordered to be carry'd as a
stuff'd monster, he would creep, as crocodiles should
do on dry land: When he stood upright, his face
peep'd from the belly of the monster; form'd monstrously
to charm indeed! The case that brought in
the mummy-lover, was plac'd in the center of the
stage behind, and the door, or, open part, stood facing
the audience upright&mdash;While they were employ'd
in their courtship, displaying their charms as lovers;
Penkethman, the crocodile, boasting much in the
beauty of his long tail, and, traversing the stage, unfortunately
made such a parade with it, that he
threw down Sarsnet (the attendant and confidant of
Mrs. Townley) flat upon her back, where she discovered
more linnen than other habitiments, and, more
skin and flesh than linnen, this began the first uproar
in the audience. The persons of the drama upon the
stage, strove to screen the accident as much as they
could, and the crocodile, Penkethman, (whose face
was a farce) rising from giving his assistance <i>to the fallen
maid</i>; unluckilly, his back encountered the case
for the mummy, which stood upright, openmouth'd,
to receive him, that case and crocodile fell backward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
with such violent noise, that the body of the crocodile
lay intirely inhum'd in the case of the mummy,
all absorb'd but the head and tail of the monster; and
the rapidity of the fall, had so forcibly jamm'd all
that appertain'd to Pinky's fair form, that all the
strength and skill of twenty people running to the
assistance of the monster, could not disengage him,
till Pallas in the likeness of hammers, saws, chissels,
and other implements in the hands of those that knew
their use, releas'd him. This scene took more than
half an hour in the action; with what roar of applause
the reader must form in his own Imagination.
Many of the audience the next night, made an interruption
of some minutes, to have the scene repeated,
which so much allarmed poor Sarsnet, that she run off
the stage extremely frighted, which provok'd a peal
of laughter from the spectators.</p>

<p>You see sir, it is some danger, to give a woman
room to talk; but I'll make an end with Bromias's
last speech in the second act of Amphytrion, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class="center">"The tongue is the last moving thing about a
woman.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
